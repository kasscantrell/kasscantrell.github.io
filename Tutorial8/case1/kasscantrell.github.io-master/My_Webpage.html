				<h3>Family</h3>
					<section>
						I got married June 24, 2017, my husband's name is Echo. <br>

						and is learning how to read in Kindergarten. <br>
					</section>
				<h3>Career</h3>
					<section>
						 I have been a waitress and bartender most of my adult life,<br>
						 but I think I could be pretty good at coding, so that's why<br>
						 I have returned back to school after a 5 year break.
					</section>
				<h3>Hobbies</h3>
					<section>
						I love nature, music festivals, hula hooping, and generally<br>
						just trying to make the world a better place.<br>
						I'm trying my hardest to be the best version of myself that<br>
						I can be.
