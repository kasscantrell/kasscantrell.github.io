(00:01:00 - 00:04:000) 
We observe today

caption2
(00:04:00 - 00:06:000) 
not a victory of party,

caption3
(00:06:00 - 00:10:000) 
but a celebration of freedom --


caption4
(00:10:00 - 00:12:000) 
symbolizing an end,

caption5
(00:12:00 - 00:15:000) 
as well as a beginning --

caption6
(00:15:00 - 00:17:000)
signifying renewal,

caption7
(00:17:00 - 00:19:000) 
as well as change, 

caption8
(00:19:00 - 00:22:000) 
For I have sworn before you

caption9
(00:22:00 - 00:24:000) 
and Almighty God

caption10
(00:24:00 - 00:27:000) 
the same solemn oath

caption11
(00:27:00 - 00:30:000) 
our forebears prescribed

caption12
(00:30:00 - 00:33:000) 
nearly a century and three-quarters ago.
