			<p>
				I am 24 years old and have been married for 2 years to my husband Echo. I have a 6 year old son named Nickolai, my parents and 2 brothers.
				I graduated Valedictorion of Seymour High School and am currently going for my CIS Associates degree. I have 2 dogs and 3 cats.
				I love EDM music and going to camping music festivals. My goal in life is simple, just to be happy with my family and enjoy the ride as I go.
